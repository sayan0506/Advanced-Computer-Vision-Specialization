# **Tensorflow Advanced Techniques Specialization Coursera**

## **Overview**

In this Specialization, you will gain practical knowledge of and hands-on training in advanced TensorFlow techniques such as style transfer, object detection, and generative machine learning.

**Course 1:** Understand the underlying basis of the Functional API and build exotic non-sequential model types, custom loss functions, and layers. 

**Course 2:** Learn how optimization works and how to use GradientTape and Autograph. Optimize training in different environments with multiple processors and chip types.

**Course 3:** Practice object detection, image segmentation, and visual interpretation of convolutions.

**Course 4:** Explore generative deep learning and how AIs can create new content, from Style Transfer through Auto Encoding and VAEs to Generative Adversarial Networks.
